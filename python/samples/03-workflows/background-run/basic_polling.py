"""
Sample: Background run with polling

What this example shows
- Starting a workflow in the background with `workflow.run_in_background()`.
- Polling for events at your own pace with `handle.poll()`.
- Checking when the workflow reaches an idle state with `handle.is_idle`.

This pattern is useful when a consumer needs to pull events on demand rather
than being pushed events via streaming. The workflow (producer) runs in a
background asyncio task and buffers events into an internal queue. The caller
(consumer) drains that queue whenever it is ready.

Prerequisites
- No external services required.
